Keep your music chat on discord updated on releases from the spotify artists you love! 

Once you follow an artist, the bot will notify your server with any new releases by that artist.

**Commands:** (Works with discord slash commands)
* /musicset - sets the current channel as the channel that release updates will send to
* /musicfollow {artist_name_or_id} - follow an artist
* /musicunfollow {artist_name} - unfollow an artist
* /musiclist - list all artists the bot is currently following.
