**Commands:** (Works with discord slash commands)
1. /musicset - sets the current channel as the channel that release updates will send to
2. /musicfollow {artist_name_or_id} - follow an artist
3. /musicunfollow {artist_name} - unfollow an artist
4. /musiclist - list all artists the bot is currently following.
